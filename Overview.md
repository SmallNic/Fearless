I want to enable people to tackle their fears. Often our fears isolate and debilitate us if we don't address them, but if we talk about them and share them, we move closer to conquering them.

My app will allow people to share their fears anonymously, start a journey to conquer that fear, and document their progress. They will also be able to follow other users' journeys, comment on it and offer support.
